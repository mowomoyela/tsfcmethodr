\description{
A fitted classification xgboost model from the caret R packe based on the
two .R files: "ts_taxonomy_results" and "ts_fc_evaluation_results"
from this package. The "ts_taxonomy_results" are applied as training features
and the "ts_fc_evaluation_results" as prediction label. Thus the model is
able to predict for new "ts_taxonomy_results" data the best performing
forecasting method out of the seven possible from the
"ts_fc_evaluation_results" file.
